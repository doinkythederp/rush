# Rush
A user-focused shell, implemented in Rust.

## Mission
Rush is a shell designed to be as user-friendly as possible, both for longtime users of other
popular shells, as well as complete beginners who are just learning how to interact with their
computer through the CLI. It largely aims to accomplish this by either modifying, replacing, or
disposing of the often-archaic conventions of the traditionally-popular shells.

## Goals
- Support for easy coloration of input and output
- Powerful built-in commands with consistent structure and usage
- Event-based plugin API for 3rd-party feature development
- Out-of-box fuzzy finding, autocompletion, and command history
- Robust aliasing system for commands and executables
- Simple customization of shell visuals (prompt, coloration, etc) & debug/verbose output
- Straightforward interface to interact with/modify the PATH variable

## Development Updates
Rush is currently looking for contributors!

## Notes
Rush is currently unavailable on Windows. It is available for MacOS and most Linux distributions. If
you are running Windows and wish to contribute to the project, you will be able to test it using WSL
or a virtual machine.
