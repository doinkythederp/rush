# Introduction

Plugins are third-party extensions to the Rush shell and are written in Rust. They allow developers to customize their experience with the shell and easily create unique features that can be shared and installed by others.

* Write plugins once, and run them anywhere.
* Powerful, event-based API allows plugins to react to what's going on in the shell.
* Plugins are written in Rust for safety and speed
* High-level development experience

This book will guide you through the process of installing, authoring, and publishing plugins. Complete example plugins are available in the [Rush Github repository](https://github.com/doinkythederp/rush/tree/plugins/examples/plugins).
